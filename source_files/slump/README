This is SLUMP; my fork of David Chess' excellent SLIGE map generator.  As
per David's request, this program is *not* called SLIGE.  I have obtained
David's permission to relicense this program under the GPL with two
non-mandatory clauses to the license to honor David's requests.

This program is designed to create levels for FreeDoom; in particular,
monsters not drawn yet by FreeDoom 0.3 will not be placed in levels.

To compile this package on a small-endian system (Inte x86 compatible,
mainly):

	make

To compile this package on a big-endian system (PowerPC, Sparc, etc.):

	cp Makefile.big-endian Makefile
	make

To use this package, type in something like this:

./slump -seed 1  
bsp SLUMP.OUT game.wad
prboom -file game.wad

Some other files needed to play FreeDoom are on the web:

	bsp: The program which converts the SLUMP.OUT in to a playable
             set of levels.

	prboom: A Linux port of the Doom engine

	http://prboom.sourceforge.net/

	freedoom: A free implementation of all the data files needed to
                  play a Doom-like game

Slump includes the following options:

-? Displays help
-rooms [n] Approximate number of rooms each level has
-seed random seed number (1-1001)
-outfile [filename] output to filename instead of SLUMP.OUT
-minlight [n] Minimum lighting level
-biwe Big weapons in the maps
-bimo Big monsters in the maps

This version has the following changes from slige:

* One big goal of slump is to always generate the same SLUMP.OUT file
  with the same seed and options, regardless of the compile-time options
  or platform this program is running on.  Right now, Slump will always
  create the same level for a given seed with the same options, regardless
  of whether the program is compile with -O0 or -O3 (because of how Slige
  handles floating point numbers, Slige generates different maps
  at each level of optimization).

* Instead of using the os-specific rand() function, Slump uses its own
  random number generator.

* Slump generates more puzzle-riented maps, and more sunny maps than
  Slige.

* Slump generates FreeDoom compatible maps: Only monsters that have been
  drawn for FreeDoom 0.3 will be placed in Slump maps.
